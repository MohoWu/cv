	abstract = {To reduce inaccuracies in the measurement of air pollutants by portable monitors it is necessary to establish quantitative calibration relationships against their respective reference analyser. This is usually done under controlled laboratory conditions or one-off static co-location alongside a reference analyser in the field, neither of which may adequately represent the extended use of portable monitors in exposure assessment research. To address this, we investigated ways of establishing and evaluating portable monitor calibration relationships from repeated intermittent deployment cycles over an extended period involving stationary deployment at a reference site, mobile monitoring, and completely switched off. We evaluated four types of portable monitors: Aeroqual Ltd. (Auckland, New Zealand) S500 O3 metal oxide and S500 {NO}2 electrochemical; {RTI} (Berkeley, {CA}, {USA}) {MicroPEM} {PM}2.5; and, {AethLabs} (San Francisco, {CA}, {USA}) {AE}51 black carbon ({BC}). Innovations in our study included: (i) comparison of calibrations derived from the individual co-locations of a portable monitor against its reference analyser or from all the co-location periods combined into a single dataset; and, (ii) evaluation of calibrated monitor estimates during transient measurements with the portable monitor close to its reference analyser at separate times from the stationary co-location calibration periods. Within the {\textasciitilde}7 month duration of the study, ‘combined’ calibration relationships for O3, {PM}2.5, and {BC} monitors from all co-locations agreed more closely on average with reference measurements than ‘individual’ calibration relationships from co-location deployment nearest in time to transient deployment periods. ‘Individual’ calibrations relationships were sometimes substantially unrepresentative of the ‘combined’ relationships. Reduced quantitative consistency in field calibration relationships for the {PM}2.5 monitors may have resulted from generally low {PM}2.5 concentrations that were encountered in this study. Aeroqual {NO}2 monitors were sensitive to both {NO}2 and O3 and unresolved biases. Overall, however, we observed that with the ‘combined’ approach, ‘indicative’ measurement accuracy (±30\% for O3, and ±50\% for {BC} and {PM}2.5) for 1 h time averaging could be maintained over the 7-month period for the monitors evaluated here.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide ({NO}2) is a ubiquitous air pollutant with high concentrations particularly close to main roads. The focus of this study was on possible differences in {NO}2 concentrations between adult and child heights as a function of different distances from heavily trafficked roads in urban areas. Passive diffusion tubes were used to measure {NO}2 concentrations at heights of 0.8 m (approximate inhalation height of children and closer to vehicle exhaust height) and 2.0 m (approximate inhalation height of adults) above the ground at a number of locations and over several weeks in the city of Edinburgh, {UK}. Evidence for significant differences in {NO}2 between heights was observed up to at least 1.2 m from kerbside of busy roads, with tubes at 0.8 m measuring concentrations 5–15 \% (a few μg m−3) greater than at 2.0 m. The vertical {NO}2 concentration difference was not observable at distances 2.5 m or greater from the kerbside. Fitting of horizontal transects of {NO}2 concentrations away from main roads demonstrated the strong influence of wind speed in yielding faster fall-off in {NO}2 concentration from the roadside, and in near-ground vertical gradient in {NO}2, and lower background {NO}2 concentrations. These observations have potential public health implications for differential {NO}2 exposures between children walking, or in buggies, close to heavily trafficked urban roads compared with adults.},

	abstract = {Land-use regression ({LUR}) models are increasingly used to estimate exposure to air pollution in urban areas. An appropriate monitoring network is an important component in the development of a robust {LUR} model. In this study concentrations of {NO}2 were simulated by a dispersion model at ‘virtual’ monitoring sites in 54 network designs of varying numbers and types of site, using a 25 km2 area in Edinburgh, {UK}, as an example location. Separate {LUR} models were developed for each network. The {LUR} models were then used to estimate {NO}2 concentration at all residential addresses, which were evaluated against the dispersion-modelled concentration at these addresses. The improvement in predictive capability of the {LUR} models was insignificant above ∼30 monitoring sites, although more sites tended to yield more precise {LUR} models. Monitoring networks containing sites located within highly populated areas better estimated {NO}2 concentrations across all residential locations. {LUR} models constructed from networks containing more roadside sites better characterised the high end of residential {NO}2 concentrations but had increased errors when considering the whole range of concentrations. No particular composition of monitoring network resulted in good estimation simultaneously across all residential {NO}2 concentration and of the highest {NO}2 levels. This evaluation with dispersion modelling has shown that previous {LUR} model validation methods may have been optimistic in their assessment of the model's predictive performance at residential locations.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work was to compare the variability in an urban area of fine particles ({PM}2.5), ultrafine particles ({UFP}) and black carbon ({BC}) and to evaluate the relationship between each particle metric and potential factors (local traffic, street topography and synoptic meteorology) contributing to the variability. Concentrations of the three particle metrics were quantified using portable monitors through a combination of mobile and static measurements in the city of Edinburgh, {UK}. The spatial variability of {UFP} and {BC} was large, of similar magnitude and about 3 times higher than the spatial variability of {PM}0.5-2.5 (the {PM} size fraction actually quantified in this work). Highest inter-daily variability was observed for {PM}0.5-2.5, which was approximately 2 times higher than inter-daily variability of {BC} and {UFP}. Elevated concentrations of {UFP} and {BC} were observed along streets with high traffic volumes whereas {PM}0.5-2.5 showed less variation between streets and a footpath without road traffic. Both {BC} and {UFP} were significantly correlated with traffic counts, while no significant correlation between {PM}0.5-2.5 and traffic counts was observed. {BC} was significantly correlated with {UFP}, with significantly different regression slopes between working days and non-working days implying that the increased number of diesel powered heavy goods vehicles during working days contributed more to {BC} than to {UFP}. It is concluded that variations in {BC} and {UFP} concentrations were mainly determined by the nearby traffic count and varying background concentrations between days, while variation in {PM}0.5-2.5 concentration was mainly associated with regional sources. These findings imply the need for different policies for managing human exposure to these different particle components: control of much {BC} and {UFP} appears to be manageable at local scale by restricting traffic emissions; however, abatement of {PM}2.5 requires a more strategic approach, in cooperation with other regions and countries on emissions control to curb long-range transport of {PM}2.5 precursors.},

	abstract = {Adverse health effects from exposure to air pollution are a global challenge and of widespread concern. Recent high ambient concentration episodes of air pollutants in European cities highlighted the dynamic nature of human exposure and the gaps in data and knowledge about exposure patterns. In order to support health impact assessment it is essential to develop a better understanding of individual exposure pathways in people's everyday lives by taking account of all environments in which people spend time. Here we describe the development, validation and results of an exposure method applied in a study conducted in Scotland.

A low-cost particle counter based on light-scattering technology — the Dylos 1700 was used. Its performance was validated in comparison with equivalent instruments ({TEOM}-{FDMS}) at two national monitoring network sites (R2 = 0.9 at a rural background site, R2 = 0.7 at an urban background site). This validation also provided two functions to convert measured {PNCs} into calculated particle mass concentrations for direct comparison of concentrations with equivalent monitoring instruments and air quality limit values.

This study also used contextual and time-based activity data to define six microenvironments ({MEs}) to assess everyday exposure of individuals to short-term {PM}2.5 concentrations. The Dylos was combined with a {GPS} receiver to track movement and exposure of individuals across the {MEs}. Seventeen volunteers collected 35 profiles. Profiles may have a different overall duration and structure with respect to times spent in different {MEs} and activities undertaken. Results indicate that due to the substantial variability across and between {MEs}, it is essential to measure near-complete exposure pathways to allow for a comprehensive assessment of the exposure risk a person encounters on a daily basis. Taking into account the information gained through personal exposure measurements, this work demonstrates the added value of data generated by the application of low-cost monitors.},
